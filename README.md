# The Hyderabad Tourism Website

The Hyderabad Tourism Guide is a web-based project that showcases the city's famous landmarks, restaurants, and IT companies. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Google Maps API integration, it offers an interactive experience for users exploring Hyderabadâ€™s culture, cuisine, and career opportunities. The homepage features a visually appealing header and an introduction highlighting the city's blend of heritage and modernity. The website is structured into three main sections: Famous Places (Macca Masjid, Salar Jung Museum, Jagannath Temple), Popular Restaurants (Paradise Biryani, Pista House), and Leading IT Companies (Microsoft, Infosys, Wipro). Interactive cards with images and descriptions provide quick insights, while Google Maps integration helps users locate restaurants in real-time.

The project is organized through tour.html, tour.css, and tour.js, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing layout with flexbox, grid, and hover effects. JavaScript enhances interactivity, including dynamic Google Maps functionality. Key features include card-based navigation, location tracking, and mobile-friendly design. Future enhancements may include search functionality, user reviews, and expanded interactive maps. The Hyderabad Tourism Guide successfully combines history, food culture, and career opportunities into a single, engaging platform, making it a valuable resource for tourists, food lovers, and job seekers.
